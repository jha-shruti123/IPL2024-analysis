# IPL2024-analysis
Determining the best playing XI of IPL 2024

Project Overview
Ever wondered who the star performers of IPL 2024 are? Which players consistently outshine others? Well, look no further! This project scrapes data from an IPL stats website and uses the power of Python, Pandas, and Power BI to bring you insights and trends that even the commentators might miss. 🎤📊

What’s Inside?
Scraping the Field
Using our custom web scraper, we fetch the latest and greatest IPL 2024 stats. Expect runs, wickets, sixes, fours, strike rates, economy rates, and perhaps even the number of times a player winks at the camera! (Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the gist).

Data Cleanup: The Pre-Match Warm-Up
Data can be messy – like a cricket ball after a rainy day. But fret not! With the magic of Pandas, we’ll clean, transform, and prepare our data for the main event. NaNs? Out! Inconsistent formats? Fixed! The data will be as pristine as a freshly mowed pitch.

Visualize the Victory
Power BI steps up to the crease, turning numbers into insights with dazzling visualizations. From pie charts to heatmaps, watch as your data comes to life, making trends and patterns as clear as a Dhoni helicopter shot. 🚁
